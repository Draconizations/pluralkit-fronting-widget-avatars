![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/805729524682981398/930534946131550258/unknown.png)

An iOS widget using the scriptable app that displays your current fronters from pluralkit.

‚ùó **Original version [HERE](https://github.com/KyrinLee/Pluralkit-Front-Widget/blob/main/scriptableCode.js)**

## Instructions
1. download [scriptable](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scriptable/id1405459188) (iOS only)
2. create a new script
3. copy and paste [Scriptable.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spectralitree/pluralkit-fronting-widget-avatars/main/Scriptable.js) into the new script
4. get your token from pluralkit (`pk;token`) and paste it at the very top of the script, right where it says you need to paste the token
5. change the settings around! basically anything above "ONLY EDIT THIS IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING" is okay to edit. (Unless you know what you're doing ofc)
6. go to your home screen, tap and hold, add a new scriptable widget in the size you want
7. set the widget to use the script you just edited
8. (optional) change the widget's setting to run the script whenever you tap on it, just as a QOL thing

If there's any weird issues or bugs, let us know!
